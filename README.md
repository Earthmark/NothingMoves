A game jam entry for the bevy jam.

The hypotheses of this game is to fold higher dimensional structures into lower dimensional structures using matrix rotations. The lower dimensional structures are mapped into bevy as models, and rendered.

This is going to be using an old idea and migrating it into Bevy, later on I'll see if this can be migrated into objects having traversable multidimensional facets.
